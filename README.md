# SQL-Projects

## 📊 Data Technician SQL & Database Fundamentals Project

### Project Overview

This project demonstrates my hands-on experience with **relational databases, SQL querying, and analytical problem-solving** through a series of structured, real-world business scenarios. Using **MySQL Workbench** and industry-standard datasets (Northwind and World databases), I translated business questions into efficient SQL queries to extract meaningful insights.

The work reflects my ability to **analyze requirements, structure data logically, and deliver actionable results**, mirroring tasks commonly performed by junior data analysts and data technicians.
